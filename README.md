# Unified Clank Infrastructure — Stage 0.5

> **Phase 0: PROPOSED FOR SUPERSESSION — promotion frozen.** ADR-0001 proposes
> `diagnostic-clank` as the canonical fleet control plane. Do not extend or
> promote this repository while the reviewed disposition remains open.

> Status: Stage 0.5 skeleton — no production behavior

See [`UNIQUE_FUNCTION_DISPOSITION.md`](UNIQUE_FUNCTION_DISPOSITION.md) and the
proposed [governance ADR](https://github.com/anil-ganti-nbc/clank-architecture/blob/phase0/containment/adr/0001-authority-and-phase0-freeze.md).

Skeleton + architecture hardening. **No production behavior.**

## Read first

1. `ARCHITECTURE_PRINCIPLES.md` — rules every agent must follow  
2. `DEPENDENCIES.md` — why each dependency exists  
3. `unified-clank-architecture-v2.1-reviewed.md` — authoritative amendments  
4. Package READMEs under each `clank-*` directory  

## Bootstrap

```bash
make bootstrap          # or: make install
make check              # lint + tests
make architecture       # guardrail tests only
```

Manual install order (if not using Make):

```bash
pip install -e "./clank-runtime[dev]"
pip install -e "./clank-fleet[dev]"
pip install -e "./clank-desktop[dev]"
```

## What works

| Surface | Behavior |
|---------|----------|
| `GET /api/v1/system/ping` | 200 — process shell only |
| All other Fleet API routes | 501 `STAGE0_NOT_IMPLEMENTED` |
| `clank version` | prints versions |
| Other `clank` commands | exit 78 + JSON envelope |
| Desktop app | window + placeholders, no API |
| Runtime contracts | validate / serialize models only |

## What must never appear in this stage

Databases, scrapers, outbox writers, Docker control, Tailscale setup, real auth, NAS paths, imports of existing clank repos, production logic inside placeholder modules.

Architecture tests enforce most of these. See `clank-fleet/tests/test_architecture.py`.

## Stages (do not jump ahead)

- **Stage 0** — skeleton (accepted)  
- **Stage 0.5** — this hardening pass  
- **Stage 1** — deployment foundation (Dockerize clanks, NAS, Tailscale, backups)  
- **Stage 2+** — Fleet API, runtime adapters, ingestion, desktop functionality
